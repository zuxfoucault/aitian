# AI展 (aitian) — Project Context

Static portal website for our AI-application meetup community (members = "aitians"). It gives the
community a branded front door, gives moderators/speakers a **citable webpage** for LinkedIn/résumé,
and records past meetups. Content is authored as Markdown, contributed via PR, and built to a static
GitHub Pages site. Full requirements/brainstorm: [`docs/kickstart.md`](docs/kickstart.md).

This file is auto-loaded every session — a small **index**, not an encyclopedia. Shared conventions
(three-part semver, devlog format, communication style) live in the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`;
don't restate them.

## Who's working on this

- **SansWord** (Wen-Kai) — building it. **pinku** — co-organizer, design/product input.
- How I like you to work: give **clear options with a recommendation**, not open-ended menus.
  **Surface decisions that are mine** (scope, naming, copy, product framing) — don't silently assume
  them. Keep the doc tree current.

## Current status

> Not restated here, to avoid drift: **what's shipped** → top row of [`docs/devlog.md`](docs/devlog.md);
> **what's next** → [`todo.md`](todo.md).

Stable facts:
- **Repo:** `sansword/aitian` (public) · **Hosting:** GitHub Pages, static site.
- **URL:** `sansword.github.io/aitian` initially; custom domain (`aitian.dev` or similar) later.
- **Stack:** static site (framework TBD — leaning vanilla HTML/CSS/JS). Data authored as Markdown +
  YAML frontmatter, built to JSON at deploy.

## Locked decisions

> Settled calls. **Implementing/planning → obey them.** **Brainstorming or explicit human decision →
> challenge freely.** If a new idea conflicts with one, name the conflict and ask align-or-unlock; to
> change one, update the canonical section + log it in [`docs/devlog.md`](docs/devlog.md). Detail and
> rationale live in [`docs/kickstart.md`](docs/kickstart.md).

- **Name:** AI展 (aitian) — Taiwanese pun (愛展 "want to demo") + "-ian" demonym → members are
  "aitians". → kickstart §0
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages, repo `sansword/aitian`; custom domain later. → kickstart §2
- **Data format:** author in Markdown + YAML frontmatter; build to JSON at deploy (page consumes JSON,
  no runtime parser). → kickstart §4b
- **Data layout:** one file per meetup/moderator under `data/`; discovery + ordering via a deploy-time
  generated `index.json` (never committed to the repo). → kickstart §4c
- **A meetup is a multi-segment session** (Talk 1 / Talk 2 / Chat), not a single talk. → kickstart §4
- **Privacy:** speaker contact info (email/thread) **never** enters the public repo — logistics stay
  in the private sign-up sheet; only topic, speaker name, and materials link are public. → kickstart §4d
- **Contribution:** speakers/moderators add or edit **their own** Markdown file via PR (conflict-free).
  → kickstart §4

## Docs — two tiers

- **Maintained `docs/*.md`** (source of truth; must match the code) — *none yet.* Add each here with a
  one-line description **and its update trigger** as the site is built (candidates: `docs/wording.md`
  for name/bilingual copy, `docs/architecture.md` for the build pipeline).
- **Historical** (how we got here; allowed to go stale; kept forever):
  - [`docs/kickstart.md`](docs/kickstart.md) — the founding brainstorm/spec. **Read before any planning.**
  - [`docs/superpowers/specs/`](docs/superpowers/specs/) & [`docs/superpowers/plans/`](docs/superpowers/plans/)
    — per-milestone specs (brainstorming output) and plans (writing-plans output). **These paths are
    the superpowers plugin defaults**, so brainstorm/write-plan land files here automatically.
  - [`docs/devlog.md`](docs/devlog.md) — newest-first history; the top row is the current state.

## Before you plan — read first

Before planning or building, **read [`docs/kickstart.md`](docs/kickstart.md)** (plus any relevant
maintained docs and the Locked decisions above), then plan against them — and **name the files you
consulted**, so it's visible which docs informed the work.

## Workflow — the dev cycle (superpowers)

Each milestone: **brainstorm → spec → plan → implement → fold decisions into the maintained docs.**

1. **Brainstorm/spec** via `superpowers:brainstorming` → saves to `docs/superpowers/specs/`.
2. **Plan** via `superpowers:writing-plans` → saves to `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
3. **Implement** against the plan (`superpowers:executing-plans` / subagent-driven).
4. Specs & plans are **historical** (may go stale). Afterward, **fold lasting decisions into the
   maintained docs** (Locked decisions above / a `docs/*.md`) — those, not the spec, are the source of
   truth.
5. **Phase handoff:** per the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, run each phase in a fresh session, carrying
   only the written doc forward.

## End of session — close the loop (a gate before any PR)

Updating docs is a **gate, not a nicety** — before the work counts as done / before a PR opens:

1. Update every maintained `docs/*.md` the session touched. ("No docs needed" is a claim to justify.)
2. Append a newest-on-top entry to [`docs/devlog.md`](docs/devlog.md) (global `CLAUDE.md` owns the
   format), linking its spec/plan.
3. Update [`todo.md`](todo.md).

When the user says **"ship it" / "raise a PR":** run this, commit the doc changes **in the same PR** as
the code, open the PR — then **stop; don't merge** (that's the user's call). If they head to push
without it, **remind them**.

## Conventions

- **Staging: explicit paths only** — never `git add -A` / `git add .`. Confirm scope with
  `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` before a PR.
- **Publish only the built site** (`dist/`) to Pages — never `path: .`; keep `CLAUDE.md`, `todo.md`,
  and `docs/` off the served site (kickstart §4c).
- **Code comments describe the *current* state only** — no "moved from…" / "used to be…" breadcrumbs;
  history lives in git.
- **Escape user-supplied input** (contributor-authored Markdown/frontmatter) even when rendering it
  verbatim ("verbatim" = don't *translate* it, not skip escaping).

## Before committing (load-bearing — public repo)

Scan **every** commit for secrets / API keys / tokens, `.env*` files, and **speaker contact info /
private PII** (kickstart §4d) before pushing. This repo is public and holds a community with private
sign-up data — this scan is required, not precautionary.
